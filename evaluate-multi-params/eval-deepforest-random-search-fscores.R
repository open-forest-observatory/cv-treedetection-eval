# Title: Evaluate DeepForest Random Search Hyperparameter Combinations
# Description: This script uses f-scores from run-tree-map-comparison.R (a
#              script that compares predicted and observed tree maps) to identify
#              the highest performing hyperparameter combination from a random search.
#              It also aims to visualize the f-scores according to hyperparameter
#              combinations via a pairwise scatter plot and parallel coordinates plot.
